# LOLCode

<Programming Challenge #3>  
Language: [LOLCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE)  
Language spec: [lolcode-spec-v1.2](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md)  
Language Interpreter: [CLI Repo](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci)  

##Challenge Brief:

Aliens have landed! They're trying to trade with us, but it looks like they just can't figure out our Base-10 number system.  
It turns out each alien uses the base of their choice for any mathematical operation!  
Help humanity trade better: make a number converter given these inputs:  
1.) Input number base
2.) Input number
3.) Desired output base

###Examples
So, for example, 115 in Base-10 is 61 in base 20. It can be written like this:  
First Digit: 6  
Second Digit: 1  

And if you want to use a digit that's larger than 10 for a non-Base-10 input, you could write it like this:  
First Digit: 1  
Second Digit: 1337  
Third Digit: 9001
