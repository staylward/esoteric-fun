A program that will take a number input and print a transcript of Count Dracula (off Sesame Street) counting it.
For example, if the number three is entered, the following lines would be printed:
"1, uh, uh uh"
"2, uh, uh uh"
"3, uh, uh uh"

The input should only be the number, and there is no need for error handling.
